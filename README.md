# Aegon-Hotel

To run the application build with mvn install and change directory to the target directory.
Execute the command 'java -jar hotel-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar'

Samples for the endpoints are included in the Postman file 'Hotel.postman_collection.json'

There is one test that I have not been able to complete. This was the test of the POST operation
which is currently failing due to a problem with converting the Booking object to its JSON
representation.
